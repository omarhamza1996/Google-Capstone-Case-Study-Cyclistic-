Hi. I have enrolled in Google’s data analytics professional certificate course and this is my final phase of the program which is to conduct a capstone project. I have chosen the Cyclistic company’s case study which is a public dataset. 

In this case study, I analyzed the usage patterns of Cyclistic bike-share customers to understand the differences between casual riders and annual members. The primary objective was to gather insights that could inform marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, thereby enhancing Cyclistic's profitability and long-term growth. The process involved downloading and cleaning 12 months of historical trip data, followed by detailed analysis using descriptive statistics and visualizations. Key findings revealed that casual riders typically have longer ride durations and prefer weekend use, while annual members show more consistent usage throughout the week, particularly for commuting. Based on these insights, targeted marketing recommendations were developed to appeal to the distinct preferences of casual riders and encourage them to become annual members.
In this article I am going to write how I have conducted this case study This is my first project and I am very excited to complete this following the data analytics steps which are Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

# Scenario
Cyclistic is a bike share company operating in a major city. Since its inception, Cyclistic has experienced significant growth, offering a fleet of thousands of bicycles available for short-term rentals across the city. The service provides a flexible and eco-friendly transportation option for both residents and tourists. Cyclistic operates on a membership model, offering both annual memberships and casual passes for single rides or daily use.
In this scenario, I am a junior data analyst on the marketing analytics team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago, I have been tasked with a project. Our director of marketing believes that the future success of our company hinges on maximizing the number of annual memberships. To achieve this, I have given a task to find out how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
